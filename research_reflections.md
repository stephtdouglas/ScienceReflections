# Reflect
 - Why did you seek out this program or project?
 - Pick three positive things from this experience, that you want to explore further (or that you wanted to explore further at that time, at least)? These could be an interesting research area, something about the group dynamic, an analysis technique, or anything else
 - If you want, pick a few negative or neutral things about this experience, that you want to avoid in future research projects. Maybe a research area you were eager to explore didnâ€™t excite you as much once you were studying it, you needed a different advising style, or you were miserable for geographical reasons
 - How did this experience inform your next project choice(s)? 
 - Was there anything else about this experience that stands out in your memory?
