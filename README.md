# Science Reflections
A guide for reflecting on scientific and personal experiences, and applying those to applications.

The initial version of this guide was developed for a workshop at the Banneker Institute 2019. It may be applicable to other science fields, but was developed for undergraduates applying to astronomy programs in particular. I am currently a postdoc, working from my own successful applications, advice given to me, and experience editing other essays. If you have comments, concerns, or additional advice, please create an issue or email me directly! (StephanieTDouglas [aT] gmail [DoT] com)

## How to use this guide
### Pick one set of reflection questions.
 - The "research" questions are explicitly intended to gather information for describing research experiences in application essays, and to provide input for choosing next steps.
 - The "personal" questions are a bit broader. These can be turned into personal essay components or just for personal reflection. 
 
### Refining your search and choosing your next step(s)

 - What skills do you want to develop further? 
 - What research areas do you want to learn more about? 
 - What do you never want to do again?
 - Especially if you still have a year or two before grad school, you can
   - Adjust your courses for the next year
   - Read/practice on your own
   - Ask your advisor if you can focus more on developing that skill during your current project
   - Look for a new job or research experience at your home campus
   - Look for an REU/summer project that will let you focus on that research area
 - If you feel a strong pull towards a particular research area, make sure there are people you can work with at any graduate programs you apply to (ideally, at least 2 people actively researching the topic). 
 - If group dynamics or mentoring style had a strong impact on your experience, find a program/group/PI who fits your preferred style (ask the PI and their students about the PI’s style)
 - If you had significant negative experiences, look for programs or locations that will remove or mitigate those factors
 - If you aren’t sure yet whether you want to pursue research/grad school, now is the time to check out other options! Use your network and try to find people who’ve taken different paths, look for summer internships in tech or other areas
 - Ask your mentors to tell you what they see as your strengths and areas you can improve. Try to talk to multiple mentors (or even peers) to get different perspectives

### Writing your application essays

 - Admissions committees primarily want to know why you want to go to an REU or graduate school, and whether you’re likely to succeed in their program. 
 - The NSF GRFP specifically is looking to fund "people, not projects" (you’re just demonstrating that you understand how to develop and present a research question, you’re not committed to that project)
 - Any time you spent staring at the moon when you were a kid doesn’t explain why you’re still interested in grad school now.
 - Look through your reflections for common themes or a consistent storyline. You don’t have to force every experience to fit that story, but if you can emphasize continuous threads running through your experiences, your essay will be more memorable and convincing. 
 - One research experience per paragraph! A possible paragraph structure: 
   - I sought out _____ research project because _____. I worked with Prof X, whose research focuses on _____. For my project, I did _______. I found that ______. As part of this project, I learned to run ____ analysis and advanced my ____ skills. I really enjoyed _____, which drove me to apply for ____ the following semester.
 - You can also have paragraphs focusing on some larger skill or concept that crosses multiple experiences. Just don't try to summarize all your research experiences under the same "programming" paragraph (for example). 
 - Make yourself the active character, e.g., “I applied for” vs. “I was offered”. Highlight your specific contributions to the project: what did _you_ do?
 - Faculty reading your essays will be tired, overworked, and reading very quickly, so make it easy for them. Try reading only your intro sentences (or intro+conclusion sentences) for each paragraph: can you still follow the broad outline of your story and accomplishments?
 - Do highlight anywhere you presented your work, especially conference talks or publications if you have them. 
   - Anything accepted (or with a good 1st referee report) where you’re a coauthor should be mentioned somewhere. For a massive collaboration paper with 100s of authors, check with your advisor.
   - In prep/submitted papers can still be helpful; check with your advisor
 - Get many people to read your essays and give you feedback. Ask them well ahead of the deadline, so they have time to read and you have time to edit.
 - See if your school has a fellowship office and/or writing tutors who can help you
 
 ## Other resources
 
 - [This book](https://www.amazon.com/Graduate-Admissions-Essays-Fourth-School/dp/1607743213) has some good prompts for thinking about "hooks" for your intro paragraph and overarching themes for the essay. Be careful because his advice is very broad, this isn't a replacement for talking to mentors in your field. (I haven't read his book myself, but Tanveer Karim used his prompts as part of a reflection aimed at developing "hooks" to introduce/frame essays, and our students found that very helpful.)
- Lucianne Walkowicz's [excellent essay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09963) "Choose Your Own Adventure: Developing A Values-Oriented Framework for Your Career" It's pitched at graduate students and postdocs, but it's never to early to start thinking about your priorities for a scientific career. 
- [Grad school shopper](https://www.gradschoolshopper.com/gradschool/) is a free electronic or paper list of current programs, which you can sort/search through based on your reflections
