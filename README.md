# Science Reflections
A guide for reflecting on scientific and personal experiences, and applying those to applications.

The initial version of this guide was developed for a workshop at the Banneker Institute 2019. It may be applicable to other science fields, but was developed for astronomy programs in particular. I am currently a postdoc, working from my own successful applications, advice given to me, and experience editing other essays. If you have comments, concerns, or additional advice, please create an issue or email me directly! (StephanieTDouglas [aT] gmail [DoT] com)

## How to use this guide
### Pick one of the sets of reflection questions.
 - The "research" questions are explicitly intended to gather information for describing research experiences in application essays, and to provide input for choosing next steps.
 - The "personal" questions are a bit broader, these can be turned into personal essay components or just for personal reflection. 
 
### Refining your search and choosing your next step(s)

 - What skills do you want to develop further? 
 - What research areas do you want to learn more about? 
 - What do you never want to do again?
 - Especially if you still have a year or two before grad school, you can
   - Adjust your courses for the next year
   - Read/practice on your own
   - Ask your advisor if you can focus more on developing that skill during your current project
   - Look for a new job or research experience at your home campus
   - Look for an REU/summer project that will let you focus on that research area
 - If you have strong positive feelings about, or are consistently drawn towards a particular research area, make sure the graduate programs you apply to have people who work in that area (ideally, at least 2 people actively researching the topic). 
 - If group dynamics or mentoring style had a strong impact on your experience, find a program/group/PI who fits your preferred style (ask the PI and their students about the PI’s style)
 - If you had significant negative experiences, look for programs or locations that will remove or mitigate those factors
 - If you aren’t sure yet whether you want to pursue research/grad school, now is the time to check out other options! Use your network and try to find people who’ve taken different paths, look for summer internships in tech or other areas
 - Ask your mentors to tell you what they see as your strengths and areas you can improve. Try to talk to multiple mentors (or even peers) to get different perspectives

### Writing your application essays

 - Admissions committees primarily want to know why you want to go to an REU or graduate school, and whether you’re likely to succeed in their program. 
 - The NSF GRFP specifically is looking to fund "people, not projects" (you’re just demonstrating that you understand how to develop and present a research question, you’re not committed to that project)
 - Any time you spent staring at the moon when you were a kid doesn’t say why you’re interested in grad school now.
 - Look through your reflections for common themes or a consistent storyline. You don’t have to force every experience to fit that story, but if you can emphasize continuous threads running through your experiences, your essay will be more memorable and convincing. 
 - One paragraph per research experience. A possible paragraph structure: 
   - I sought out _____ research project because _____. I worked with Prof X, whose research focuses on _____. For my project, I did _______. I found that ______. As part of this project, I learned to run ____ analysis and advanced my ____ skills. I really enjoyed _____, which drove me to apply for ____ the following semester.
 - Make yourself the active character in your story, e.g., “I applied for” vs. “I was offered”. Highlight your specific contributions to the project. What did you do?
 - Faculty reading your essays will be tired, overworked, and reading very quickly. Try reading only your intro sentences (or intro+conclusion sentences) for each paragraph: can you still follow the broad outline of your story and accomplishments?
 - Do highlight anywhere you presented your work, especially conference talks or publications (or publication plans) if you have them. 
   - Anything accepted (or with a good 1st referee report) where you’re a coauthor should be mentioned somewhere. For a massive collaboration paper with 100s of authors, check with your advisor.
   - In prep/submitted papers can still be helpful; check with your advisor
 - Get as many people as you can to read your essays and give you feedback. Ask them well ahead of the deadline, so they have time to read and you have time to edit.
 - See if your school has a fellowship office and/or writing tutors who can help you
 
 ### Other resources
 
 - [This book](https://www.amazon.com/Graduate-Admissions-Essays-Fourth-School/dp/1607743213) has some good prompts for thinking about "hooks" for your intro paragraph and overarching themes for the essay. Be careful because his advice is very broad, this isn't a replacement for talking to mentors in your field.
